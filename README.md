## A/B Testing: the frequentist and the Bayesian approach

A/B testing consists of comparing two versions of something to determine which one performs better. This could mean comparing two web pages, emails, marketing campaigns, or product design.

In A/B testing, the two versions, known as variant A and variant B, are presented to two different customer groups at the same time. To check whether A performs better than B or vice-versa, measures such as clicks, conversions, time spent on the web page, or the number of bought products can be used.

In this project, we take a look at a data problem and compare two statistical approaches: frequentist and bayesian.
